# Hey, I'm Yash 👋

I build AI products that are practical, fast, and privacy-first.

## What I'm focused on
- Shipping AI-native products from idea → production
- Local-first + privacy-first tools
- Agentic workflows and developer tooling

## Current projects
- **OneChat / Younai** — persistent memory chat experiences
- **noll-pdf / pdfcraft** — privacy-first document workflows
- **mcp-use / skybridge / opencode ecosystem** — agent + MCP tooling

## Build philosophy
- Ship fast, iterate daily
- Keep UX sharp and simple
- Prefer systems that compound over hacks
